GCS98v2
- find footprint for JST SH 4-pin connectors
- check to make sure it will work with the aio03-designed USB-C daughter board
- finalize outline of board to minimize space occupied outside of keycap footprint
- have someone verify board design for:
  * daughter board properly filters power rail/provides protection from ESD and other stuff
  * MCU is properly supplied with power and signal
  * MCU does actually have an internal oscillator and whether it will be sufficient
  * whether board has room for rgb to be added
  * overall design, whether it would function once assembled
        -> from here can fork off and work on v3 to add RGB
- start work toward midplate and case design:
  * manufacture (method and manufacturer)
  * materials
  * mounting method (gasket mounting ???)
  * modularity for loud/quiet versions (foam sheet, o-rings, rubber feet)

GCS98v2
- check to make sure it will work with the aio03-designed USB-C daughter board
		= didn't verify 100% but it seems like it'll work
- finalize outline of board to minimize space occupied outside of keycap footprint
- have someone verify board design for:
		= should probably get a full design review before ordering parts if possible
  * daughter board properly filters power rail/provides protection from ESD and other stuff
		= pretty sure yea
  * MCU is properly supplied with power and signal
		= yup, but beware  pull-up resistor on D+
  * MCU does actually have an internal oscillator and whether it will be sufficient
		= internal resonator only for boot and low-speed operations, clock tends to vary
		widely with temperature; I am adding a crystal to the PCB
  * whether board has room for rgb to be added
		= yaes, check out sk6812 Mini-E RGB
  * overall design, whether it would function once assembled
        -> from here can fork off and work on v3 to add RGB
- start work toward midplate and case design:
  * manufacture (method and manufacturer)
  * materials
  * mounting method (gasket mounting ???)
  * modularity for loud/quiet versions (foam sheet, o-rings, rubber feet)
