# GCS98
A collection of PCB and case designs for a modified 1800 layout I call GCS98.

I enjoy the flexibility of a full-size keyboard, but in my decade or so of using keyboards (including software for general home use, programming, gaming, and engineering work), I have never found a use for certain keys in and around the navigation cluster, namely Page Up, Page Down, Insert, Scroll Lock, Num Lock, and Pause Break. Additionally, the full size layout is not ergonomic in terms of gaming.

I discovered the 96% and 1800 layouts and felt I had discovered the perfect out-of-the-box solution in the 1800 layout specifically, but was disappointed to find that the layout is somewhat rare. My searches led me to the Keychron K4 (with this specific configuration https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-version-2?variant=32287344427097), and after substituting in Glorious Panda Switches for most keys and upgrading to PBT keys for the first time, I finally had a keyboard that felt like mine. Unfortunately, the K4 still has one major drawback being a compact 96% layout as opposed to a proper 1800: the remaining navigation keys, arrow keys, and delete key are not easily accessible by touch. 

To get the last 4% of customization that the compact 96% layout leaves in the aether, the only option forward is to do a fully custom build. I am a mechanical engineer by trade and I am familiar with the kinds of tools to design and manufacture a housed PCB; my specialty is not in electronics though, so I will inevitably be following tutorials and asking for help. 

Feel free to share this project with others, I've already been asked a couple of times whether I'd consider doing a group buy around this layout. You can also contact me over Discord Iratium#4718 or email at gavinshehan@gmail.com.
